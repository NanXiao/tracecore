title: Read Li Na's autobiography
---
During this mid-autumn vacation, I read the Li Na's autobiography ([http://item.jd.com/11052054.html](http://item.jd.com/11052054.html)). Previously, I can only know Li Na from reports and news written by journalists, but from this book, I recognize a real Li Na.
 
She is also a common girl, and has the same feelings as other people. Below her success, She endures more pains and pressures than common people. We can give her more toleration and applauses rather than criticisms.

Good luck with you, Li Na!
